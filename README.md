This repository contains the Python code for analyzing a dataset focused on understanding the relationship between exercise and migraine severity. The data comes from 52 patients and includes key variables such as exercise habits, BMI, age, and migraine severity scores (MIDAS and MSQ). The goal of the analysis is to explore how different exercise routines and other health factors correlate with the frequency and intensity of migraines. The project includes data preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data, as well as exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation testing, and statistical analyses like regression and ANOVA to examine these relationships. The code is designed to run in Google Colab, using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and statsmodels to process, analyze, and visualize the data. The repository also contains the necessary notebooks and scripts to reproduce the analysis and generate insights into how exercise may help reduce migraine severity. For those interested in contributing, the project is open for further suggestions, improvements, and collaborations.
